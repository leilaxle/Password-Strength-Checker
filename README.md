# Password-Strength-Checker

Description:
This Python script provides two functionalities: password strength checking and strong password generation. It aims to assist users in evaluating the strength of their passwords and creating strong ones to enhance information security. The tool considers factors such as length, presence of uppercase letters, digits, and special characters to determine the strength of a password.

Features:
Password Strength Checking: Users can input their passwords to assess their strength. The tool categorizes passwords into various strength levels, including Weak, Semi Strong, Strong, and Very Strong, based on predefined criteria.
Strong Password Generation: Users can generate strong passwords of desired lengths with a mixture of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. This feature ensures the creation of robust passwords that are difficult to crack.
User-Friendly Interface: The tool provides a simple and intuitive interface with menu options, guiding users through the password checking and generation processes. Users can easily navigate between functionalities and choose their desired actions.
Usage:

1. Run the script and follow the on-screen prompts.
2. Choose between password strength checking, strong password generation, or exiting the program.
3. For password strength checking, enter the password to be evaluated.
4. For strong password generation, specify the desired length of the password.
5. Receive feedback on the strength of the password or the generated strong password.
6. Optionally, continue checking passwords, generating strong passwords, or return to the main menu.

Requirements:
- Python 3.x

Note:
While this tool can help users create and evaluate strong passwords, it's essential to practice good password hygiene, such as using unique passwords for different accounts and regularly updating them, to maintain optimal security posture.
